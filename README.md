# subreddit-scraper
Python code for scraping subreddit data and storing it in a data frame.

You will need to create a subreddit account as well as a Reddit app / bot, which you can learn how to do with free guides like the one at this url: https://www.pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/.

I've included a .txt that you will only scrape the top 250 subreddits by subscriber size. The full list included 1.08 million subreddits, which takes about a month to run to scrape.
